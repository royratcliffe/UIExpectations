# UIKit Expectations

Provides [Objective-C Spec Matchers](https://github.com/OCCukes/OCExpectations) (`OCSpecMatcher` sub-classes) for UIKit. The project has one static library target which marries `OCExpectations` with the `UIAutomation` private framework. In short, you can express expectations about your iOS application using Apple's own automation API.
